Welcome to my quiz. Click the start button to begin. Test your coding knowledge as fast as possible. Guess quickly and you will score high. However, guess too quickly and your score goes down. Don't guess at all...well you'll see :)

This project uses local storage to store your initials and your score. Keep practicing to score even higher than last time. Try it with friends and rank to the top of your coding coterie.
